HARDWARE

When it comes to HARDWARE development, testing is an essential part of the process. Testing helps to ensure that the HARDWARE meets the desired requirements and specifications. The testing process involves running various test cases, each of which checks a specific aspect of the HARDWARE's functionality. These test cases are designed to be repeatable, meaning that they can be run multiple times to ensure that the HARDWARE continues to function as expected. By running repeatable test cases, developers can quickly identify and fix any issues that arise, ensuring that the HARDWARE is of high quality and meets the needs of its users. Overall, repeatable testing is crucial for delivering reliable and robust HARDWARE.
